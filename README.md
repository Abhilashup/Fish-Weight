# Fish Weight Prediction


# Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to build an efficient machine learning model that helps to measure the weight of certain types of Fish.

# About the Project
This is a model that predicts the weight of a fish given various features like Lengths, Height and Width. 

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle and has the following as its features :

 1.Species - The type of fish.
 2.Weight of the fish in grams(g) - This will be our dependant variable or the predictand.
 3.Length 1 is the Vertical Length of the fish in centimeters(cm).
 4.Length 2 is the Diagonal Length of the fish in centimeters(cm).
 5.Length 3 is the Cross Length of the fish in centimeters(cm).
 6.Height of the fish in centimeters(cm).
7.Width of the fish in centimeters(cm).
